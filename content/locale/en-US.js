What we love about them is how aware of what they present and how they present it, and their consideration of Arab women and Arab culture. For Mauj, we developed a tone that balances the poetic with the clear, direct, and educational.",
    "meeting.title": "How did we meet?",
    "meeting.para1": "In February 2020, we submitted a pitch to a mysterious new client, knowing nothing at the time except it being a platform concerned with women's health. We prepared a cheeky pitch with in-depth research and compelling samples. In turn, this mysterious client loved our work and picked us in a heartbeat.",
    "meeting.para2": "It was then that we were formally introduced to Mauj, becoming their writing partners on a year-long contract.",
    "meeting.para3": "This is what we did with Mauj. At the begging, Mauj started with another name – one that carries hidden meaning. They were likely going to encounter some obstacles, or reach an unintended audience that was unlikely to support their message. After we won the pitch (with flying colors!) we suggested they change their old name to another one more in line with their vision and direction, and this required many intensive sessions together to convince them of the need for change – after which we absolutely fell in love with their new choice, Mauj.",

As the words came together, visions of the brand became clearer, and we were, in a sense, helping set the foundation for Mauj's emeregence. That was the ground from which we took off to write their social media content.",
    "tone.para2": "We knew very well that addressing topics on women's sexual health was unfamiliar but also necessary. This is why we always vet the best and smoothest ways to introduce these topics, and how the audience could join in on a constructive conversation. Mauj's social media launched in September 2020, gradually delving into more \"taboo\" topics throughout a six-month period.",
    "tone.para3": "What makes our work exceptional with Mauj is our collaboration with their team. We think together about which topics to discuss, and about the dates of publication, contemplating whether or not a post is suitable for its publication date, or if there's an event that would be in conflict with the content? We also help them develop their ideas; they are dear clients and valuable partners, and we love what they do with their work and the limits they push.",

    "brand.para1": "Mauj received 37K followers in the first five months alone, without ever resorting to promotions or paid advertisements. Over 20 of the posts we wrote received 80% more engagement than average, and more than 30 posts have receieved over 5,000 likes.",

That’s exactly what the Mauzoun Team is.",
    "testimony.para3": "They have mastered the Arabic language, are culturally tapped in, understand the ins and outs of social norms, always add their creative magic to all that they do, and are up for a challenge any day. <b>The harder the brief or ask, the more excited they get and the better the work.</b> They inspire us to up our strategy, put out better work, think harder, and act faster. They are willing to bend over backwards to get us to meet our objectives, and that kind of partnership doesn’t come easy. We are so thankful to have such an impressive group of strong, smart, and witty writers who we get to call our partners.",

Ever since, we worked with Suha towards realizing her dream. It's been a year since we set out on our journey together, with its course continuing to unfold. ",

Our team of writers continued with the naming process. We were more than glad to do so because with naming, this is a more than a common occurrence. Ironically, after Suha consulted her friends and family, she was met with resounding enthusiasm for the allure of Musa & Palm, and she was sold on the name.",
    "longStory.title2": "Just as the seedling blooms into the palm tree, great work takes precious time.",

Plus, who can say no to the exquisite taste of a Sukkari date filled with decadently creamy goat cheese topped with slivers of premium sun-dried tomatoes?",
    "invitation.para2": "Reading what we wrote and witnessing it in print was one of our happiest moments. How delightful it was to see the fruits of our year-long labor, and how incredible it felt to grow alongside Suha, to believe in her dreams, and bring those dreams closer to life.",
